1. What are the benefits of simulating a drone with software/hardware-in-the-loop before flying?
    * Cheaper
    * Software testing
    * Testing processing power
    * Testing comms links
    * Don't need to take the drone out to test
    * Can train AI models with thousands of semi-real flights
        * Can't feasibly train RL with real drone

2. How is machine learning used to improve drone autonomy (navigation, obstacle avoidance, etc.)? What benefits does it have over traditional guidance systems like PID loops?
    * Supervised learning
    * Unsupervised learning
    * Reinforcement learning
    * Can improve navigation/path planning in cluttered environments
    * Real-time obstacle avoidance using vision models
    * Adaptive control under disturbances

3. What is ROS, and why is it universal in autonomous robotics?
    * stands for robot operating system
    * it's not actually an operating system
    * open source for robotics
    * modularity, communication, ecosystem, and simulation support

4. What are the steps/challenges of deploying ROS on embedded systems like the drone?
    * There are many different versions of ROS
    * Integration is hard
