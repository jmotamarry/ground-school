1. How do we communicate with the drone while itâ€™s in the air?
    * Ground station communicates with the onboard computer over WiFi (UDP)
    * The drone is a WiFi hotspot
    * Two main protocols - UDP and TCP
    * UDP
        * Throw a bunch of data
        * No reliability
        * Packet loss but much faster
    * TCP
        * Make sure you have a user session between both sides before sending data
        * Very reliable, good for file transfers
    * UDP is better for drone because mainly 1 way communication and speed matters
    * RC Transmitters (TX)
    * RC Receivers (RX)

2. What is the role of the onboard computer system and how does it complement the flight controller? How does it communicate?
    * Onboard Computer Functions
        * Arbitratily complex decision making
        * Robot os
        * Inference
    * Onboard computer usually communicates over standard protocols like USB
    * Builtin AI accelerator for faster inference
    * It complements the flight controller by computing complex things and sending instructions
    * The flight controller does the low-level work to implement those instructions
    * Running Ubuntu
    * ROS runs on linnux

3. What are the trade-offs between different data links (WiFi, radio, LTE)?
    * WiFi
        * High bandwith
        * Common in most computers
        * Works well for short-range comms
        * Limited range
        * Interference in most commonly used bands
        * Line of sight required
    * Radio
        * Long range
        * Reliable; low-latency
        * Works without cellular or WiFi
        * Lower bandwith so less data can be sent
        * Requires dedicated hardware, not built in to computers usually
        * Regulations on allowed frequencies
    * LTE
        * Very wide coverage
        * High bandwith
        * Line of sight to ground station not necessary
        * Currently used on Skydio drones
        * Latency higher than WiFi and radio
        * Requires SIM card/data plan
        * Dead zones possible if far from cities

4. How does the onboard computer connect to the ground station or other devices over WiFi? (SSH tutorial)
    * You ssh into the onboard computer
    * SSH commands
