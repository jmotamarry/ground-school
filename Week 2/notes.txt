1. How are drones used for aerial imagery purposes?
    * Useful in search and rescue, agriculture, law enforcement, environmentalism, competitions, etc.
    * Oblique vs Nadir aerial imagery
    * RGB-D vs multi-spectral vs plain RGB

2. How is OpenCV used for computer vision purposes? How do we use it as a club?
    * It is used as a library in Python and C++ for image and video processing
    * Some features it includes
        * feature detection
        * 3D reconstruction
        * motion analysis
        * optical flow
        * photo manipulation/de-blur/refining
        * Video editing/read/write
    * The club has used it for
        * Feature detection (SIFT, ORB)
        * Feature matching
        * Image manupulation

3. What are some pre-made alternatives to writing our own aerial imagery code, and how do they work? What are the drawbacks?
    * OpenDroneMap
        * Much simpler to use
        * Gives lots of interesting extra data
        * Not optimized for being done in flight
        * Can be slow
        * Runs poorly without GPS

4. Whatâ€™s the next steps forward as a club?
    * Try again to make a custom image stitching/SFM algorithm with OpenCV that runs realtime on drone
    * Dive deeper into OpenDroneMap and figure out how to divide the stitching into small subcomponents -> also realtime
    * Simultaneous Location and Mapping
    * Optical flow
    * Structure from motion - getting a terrain map from image data
    * Applying drone imagery - climate research with Oksana
