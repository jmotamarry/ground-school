1. What is the role of a flight controller in a drone system, and how does it differ from an onboard computer (like a Jetson)?
    * Flight controller
        * Only job is to use its sensors to keep the drone flying and balanced
        * Not very autonomous -> needs commands from person or computer
    * Onboard computer
        * Sends commands to flight controller for effect on drone
        * Can run operating systems
        * Can do computer vision, autonomous commands, mapping, etc

2. What sensors are typically connected to a flight controller?
    * Inertial measurement unit
        * Accelerometer
        * Gyroscope
    * Barometer
        * Hard to know what actual altitute is, can give a relative altitude based on air pressure
    * Magnetometer
        * Compass
        * Determines heading
    * GPS module
        * Global position
        * Velocity
        * Time
        * Enables waypoint navigation, return to home, and geofencing
    * Drone cameras
        * Full color images and video
        * Can send optical data to flight controller and onboard computer
        * Mapping, inspection, and aerial photography
        * Gimbal mounted for stabilized footage

3. What are the key communication protocols between flight controllers and peripherals (e.g. I2C, CAN, MAVLink)?
    * Serial (UART)
        * Direct and basic
        * Communication between two devices
        * Between flight controller and onboard computer
        * Radios use to communicate to flight controller
        * Common for MAVLink messages and debugging
    * CAN (Controller Area Network)
        * Similar to a "group chat" for devices
        * Used in cars and high end devices
        * Good for unpredictable environments and long cables
        * Used for smart ESCs, gimbals, and advanced sensor networks
    * I2C
        * Low speed communication with devices like barometers, magnetometers, and IMUs
        * Two wires, data and clock
        * Multiple devices can be on the same bus but only one at a time
    * SPI
        * Same as UART but multiple devices are listening to one "master" device
    * MAVLink (Micro Air Vehicle Link)
        * "Drone language" for commands and telemetry
        * Message format that runs over Serial, UDP, or CAN
        * Used to send comands and receive data
        * Powers communication between flight controller and onboard computer or ground station
    * DDS (Data Distribution Service -> like mavlink but inside drone)
        * Used by ROS 2 and modern drone systems
        * Has real-time publish-subscribe messaging between modules
        * Direct communication between flight controllers and onboard computers
        * Great for control loops

4. How does firmware (e.g. Betaflight) influence the capabilities of the flight controller?
    * Low-level software that runs on the flight computer and is not developed by the team
    * Ardupilot, Betaflight, PIX4
    * Can be configured
