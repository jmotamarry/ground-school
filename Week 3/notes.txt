1. What are some methods used for blob detection?
    *

2. How can blob detection be used to find objects in a field? What are its benefits and limitations?


3. What are the underlying mechanics of the convolutional neural network used in the YOLO model?


4. How can our club leverage our manpower to label many images in a short amount of time on roboflow? (Teach them how to use roboflow so that when we need to label a bunch of images quickly, we can use the built in roboflow tools to mobilize quickly)


5. What are some upsides and downsides to using YOLO for our competition vehicle?


6. What other techniques might there be for object detection?
